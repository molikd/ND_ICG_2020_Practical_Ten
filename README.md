ND ICG 2020 Practical Ten

In ND ICG 2020 Practical Four you created a distance matrix, now reuse that code and make it so it plots a MDS (Multidimensional Scaling) colored by your favorite clustering algorithm. 

There should be a practical.sh that calls a julia script with arguments, it should then output a png of the MDS (using plotly). The color of the points in the MDS should be determined by a clustering algorithm.
